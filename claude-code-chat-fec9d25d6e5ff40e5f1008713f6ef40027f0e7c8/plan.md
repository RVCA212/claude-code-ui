"create a plan for this task into a new .md file: <task>\nhow can we create a clean ui for allowing the user to select the current working directory for the claude code session to operate in? currently it only operates within this app's cwd but I want it to be default to the user's root directory with the option to be in any directory in the user's machine. I would like an option to toggle the sidebar state to control this between showing past conversations and toggling to instead see the cwd folders/files and being able to easily switch the cwd. I'm not sure of the best ui or how to get this information, so please analyze my app @renderer/app.js to think through the best ui for doing this and ensure that it's functional within my claude app which uses @sdk.md\n</task>"
