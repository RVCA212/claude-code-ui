Problem Diagnosis: File Browser Not Working During Chat Streaming

Root Cause Found:
After analyzing the codebase, I've identified that the issue is NOT caused by any
intentional disabling of file browser interactions during streaming. The file
browser component (file-browser.js) and file editor component (file-editor.js)
have no code that checks for streaming state or disables functionality during chat
 activity.

Key Findings:

1. No Streaming Interference: The handleFileClick() method in
file-browser.js:414-432 has no streaming checks and should work normally during
chat.
2. No Global Disabling: There are no CSS rules or JavaScript code that globally
disable pointer events or interactions during streaming.
3. Monaco Editor Issue: The most likely cause is a Monaco Editor initialization
race condition or DOM interference when both chat streaming and file opening occur
 simultaneously.

Likely Issues:

1. DOM Conflict: The Monaco editor (file-editor.js:219-252) creates DOM elements
that might conflict with streaming message updates
2. Event Handler Interference: Chat streaming might be interfering with file
browser event propagation
3. Component State Race: File editor initialization might fail silently during
heavy DOM updates from streaming

Solution Plan:

1. Add Debug Logging: Add comprehensive logging to track file click events and
Monaco initialization during streaming
2. Implement Click Queuing: Queue file open requests during streaming and process
them after streaming completes
3. Improve Error Handling: Add better error handling and user feedback when file
opening fails
4. DOM Isolation: Ensure Monaco editor DOM creation is properly isolated from
streaming updates
5. Add Loading States: Provide clear visual feedback when files are being opened
during active streaming

This fix will ensure users can browse and open files while maintaining
uninterrupted chat functionality.
