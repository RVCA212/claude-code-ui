  I've successfully identified and fixed the session ID mismatch issue in your Claude Code Chat
  application. Here's what was accomplished:

  Root Cause Identified

  The problem was session metadata corruption in ~/.claude-code-chat/sessions.json:
  - Session 4d34c036-728d-4dd6-a92c-28ad8770ce4f had corrupted metadata
  - The session messages were about "removing" a project tree, but metadata claimed it was about
  "adding" one
  - Wrong claudeSessionId, lastUserMessage, cwd, and other fields were stored

  Fixes Implemented

  1. ✅ Data Correction:
    - Fixed corrupted session metadata to match actual message content
    - Corrected lastUserMessage from "add a project tree..." to "remove the project tree from
  @README.md"
    - Generated new claudeSessionId to replace the conflicting one
    - Fixed working directory from /Users/seansullivan/portfolio-starter-kit-3 to
  /Users/seansullivan/Downloads/claude-code-chat
    - Cleaned up stale checkpoint data that was causing the mismatch
  2. ✅ Data Validation Added:
    - Enhanced SessionManager with validateSessionMetadata() method
    - Automatic detection and correction of metadata inconsistencies
    - Validation of session metadata consistency during saves
    - UUID format validation for Claude session IDs
  3. ✅ Better Error Handling:
    - Improved CheckpointManager debugging output
    - Detailed logging when checkpoints aren't found
    - Shows available sessions and message IDs for troubleshooting
    - Helps identify session/message ID mismatches in the future
  4. ✅ Database Cleanup:
    - Removed stale checkpoint data that was causing confusion
    - Deleted orphaned blob files

  The Issue Explained

  Your application uses two types of session IDs:
  - Internal Session ID: 4d34c036-728d-4dd6-a92c-28ad8770ce4f (used for operations)
  - Claude Session ID: f526b027... (displayed in UI for continuity)

  The system was working correctly, but the corrupted metadata caused the wrong Claude session ID to
  be displayed while operations used the correct internal ID. The checkpoint system couldn't find
  records because it was looking for message IDs that had been overwritten by corrupted data.

  Result

  The restore checkpoint functionality should now work properly. The session metadata is consistent,
  stale checkpoint data has been cleaned up, and future data corruption will be automatically detected
   and corrected by the new validation system.
